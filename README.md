# Immersive Science Visualization

## Naming Prefixes

- `isv` is for "Immersive Science Visualizations"
- `noc` is for my "Nature of Code" example project
- `bx` is for examples made for my own reference, e.i. "Bryan eXample"

## Project Details

This is part of a larger attempt to make science visualizations that present as generative art.

## Installation

Place any of these apps in your `myApps` folder for openFrameworks. You will need to update the projects with ProjectGenerator to run on your platform if it is not a 64-bit Mac.
